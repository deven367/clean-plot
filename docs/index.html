<p>Another way to install the library would be to build from source. It is more likely that the released version may contain bugs. The source would get updated more often. If you plan to add features to <code>clean_plot</code> yourself, or want to be on the cutting edge, you can use an editable install.</p>

<p>The library contains easy to use methods for cleaning text, tokenizing and lemmatizing sentences. These sentences can then be easily fed to a sentence encoder to create sentence embeddings.</p>

<pre>MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt
whatever about that. The register of his burial was
signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,
and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and
Scrooge&#39;s name was good upon &#39;Change, for anything he
chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a
door-nail.

Mind! I don&#39;t mean to say that I know, of my
own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about
a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to
regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery
in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors
is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands
shall not disturb it, or the Country&#39;s done for. You
will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

<p>This library has come into existence because of <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a> (one of many amazing tools made by <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>). PRs and Issues are encouraged.</p>
<p>After you clone this repository, please run <code>nbdev_install_git_hooks</code> in your terminal. This sets up git hooks, which clean up the notebooks to remove the extraneous stuff stored in the notebooks (e.g. which cells you ran) which causes unnecessary merge conflicts.</p>
<p>Before submitting a PR, check that the local library and notebooks match. The script <code>nbdev_diff_nbs</code> can let you know if there is a difference between the local library and the notebooks.</p>
<p>If you made a change to the notebooks in one of the exported cells, you can export it to the library with <code>nbdev_build_lib</code> or <code>make clean_plot</code>.</p>
<p>If you made a change to the library, you can export it back to the notebooks with <code>nbdev_update_lib</code>.</p>
